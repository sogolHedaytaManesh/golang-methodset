## ðŸš€ Running the Examples

Each example contains a `main.go` file and can be run using:

```bash
cd 01_basics
go run main.go
```

## ðŸ“– Key Points

- **Method Set** determines which methods are accessible on a type.
- **Value receiver methods** can be called on both values and pointers.
- **Pointer receiver methods** can only be called on pointers.
- For **interfaces**, the method set determines if a type implements the interface.
- With **embedding**, methods from the embedded struct are promoted to the outer struct.

## ðŸ’» Interview Exercises

The `09_interview_exercises` folder contains tricky exercises.  
Try to predict the output before looking at the solutions.
